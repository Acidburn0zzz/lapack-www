* 1/14/2016: Jim:  This is a bug that was posited could occur due to non-reproducibility but has not actually happened.  This has not occurred in any application.  I would like to see this be part of a bigger, longer term discussion.
* 2/11/16: Jim:  Not really a bug, but possibly a future bug.  I would rather talk about this in the larger context of reproducibility.
