== [red]*bug 159* DSTEMR - consolidates bugs 113 and 126
* *CONFIRMED*
* Present in LAPACK 3.6.0
* Assigned to Osni.
* Osni: We have a new subroutine to replace the subroutine causing us trouble.  We will be sitting together (OM and Prof. Parlett) tomorrow to discuss how this will behave.
* I expect the new version of the subroutine will fix bug 113
* 02/10/16 Osni: The bug has been traced to the factorization(s) performed by dlarrf. 
* The current implementation of dlarrf can lead to NaNs or element growth (this is expected) but the tests to deal with these cases are not working properly.
* Beresford and I have experimented changing a few things in dlarrf, which fixes this bug and also bug 126, but we know that a more robust strategy needs to be devised. 
* 2/11/16: We were able to trace the issue down here to the factorizations.  We have some tests to cope with extreme growth in elements and NaNs, 
* but these tests are not robust.  So we end up with linearly dependent eigenvectors when eigenvalues are close to each other.
* 5/9/16: (Osni) We had a meeting in Berkeley (Prof. Parlett, Jim, Osni, I Dhillon) Some safeguards were removed over the years thinking we did not need them;
* perhaps they must come back (this was the focus of our discussion).  For some matrices, the vectors that are returned are not orthogonal the way we would 
* like them to be---the level of orthogonality is not ideal for nearly multiple eigenvalues.  Prof Parlett and I will sit together to determine the best strategy for future LAPACK release. 

== [red]*bug 158* problem with DC SVD least squares
* *CONFIRMED*
* Present in LAPACK 3.6.0
* Bug reported by Alexander Kobotov in 2015 to Julien
* Problem of size ~22K with a large number of singular values close to 1.
* dlasd7 fails to merge two sets of (very close) singular values together into a single sorted set, and subsequently dlasd4 (secular equation solver) fails to converge.
* See email to LAPACK team
* Assigned to Osni.

== [red]*bug 130* :: Ambiguous lapacke interfaces to Cosine/Sine decomposition - 2 Trans parameters
* *CONFIRMED* on July 9th 2015
* Present in LAPACK 3.5.0
* Bug reported by Victor Kostin (INTEL) on July 9th
* Link: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4748
* Confirmed by Julie on July 9th 2015

== [red]*bug 126* :: DSTEMR -  misbehaviour of DLARRF
* *CONFIRMED* on Jun 24th 2015
* Present in LAPACK 3.5.0
* Bug reported by Miroslav Ilias on Jun 27th
* Link: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1820
* Assigned to Osni
* 02/10/16 Osni: The bug was originally thought to be related to splitting but is rather a misbehavior of DLARRF (in the presence of very tight eigenvalues); see bug 113.
* SEE BUG 113 for all updates (will be closed along with 113)

== [maroon]*bug116* :: ZGGEV fails but Matlab works
* *NOT CONFIRMED*
* Present in LAPACK 3.5.0
* Bug report by Victor Liu, Standford on LAPACK Forum  - August 20th 2013
* Assigned to Julien (UC Denver) on Feb 11th 2015
* Links: http://icl.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4357

== [red]*bug0061* :: zgehrd.f is overflowing 
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report by Victor Liu on Tuesday August 03rd, 2010
 * zgehrd.f is overflowing  the maximum size in bytes of the largest array that
 * can be put on the stack with gfortran (=> leads ,e.g., to non-reproducible and uncorrect execution
 * of zgeev in multithreaded context
 * lapackers involved in the bug fix process: Julie and Julien Langou and Mathieu Faverge
 * bug fix by Victor Liu on Wednesday August 04th, 2010
 * Assigned to Julien (UC Denver) on Feb 11th 2015
 * see link:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1930[forum topic 1930]
 * two outstanding issues: (1) how do we go to fix this?, (2) more LAPACK subroutines might be concerned.
